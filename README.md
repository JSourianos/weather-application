# Code Challenge

## How to run the project

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```



## Project structure
* `src/app` contains the routing and layout configuration for the app, based on Expo's File Based Routing. The screens are defined separately in the `src/screens` folder, to avoid clutter in the `app` folder.

## ESLint and Prettier
* ESLint and Prettier are used to maintain code quality and consistency.
